Odd One Out is a multiplayer game in which one person is assigned to be the odd one out while 
all other players are assigned a role at a location. The Odd one Out's objective is to figure out the location through a series of well-worded questions while not giving
away that he or she is the Odd One Out. Meanwhile, everyone else's objective is to figure out the Odd One Out. All players take turns asking questions and having fun!
