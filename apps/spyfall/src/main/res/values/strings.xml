    <string name="rules_message"> • Spyfall is a game best played with 3 or more players. \n • Once the game starts a
        location such as “pirate ship” or “library is chosen”. \n • Everyone is made aware of the location and assigned
        a role at the location. Everyone except for the player randomly assigned to be the spy that is. \n • Starting with
        the player assigned to be first, each player takes turns asking each other questions that only someone who is
        not the spy would know such as “ Is this a place you would bring your family? “ \n • The players goals are to find
        out who the spy is, and also make sure the spy does not find out what the location is. \n • The spy’s goal is to not
        get found out as the spy, and to find out what the location is. \n • When the timer is up, everyone votes on who
        they think the spy is. \n • The spy then reveals themselves, and votes on what they think the location is.\n •  If the
        spy gets the location right, the spy wins. Otherwise, everyone who guesses the spy correctly wins.  \n • Have fun! </string>
