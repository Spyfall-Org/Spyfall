    We follow the following format for our strings: nameSpace_usage_type

    nameSpace:
        Lowest common logical ancestor that owns this string.
        Frequently this will be the name of the feature module but could be a sub feature or
        a logical group in the app. Or for app wide strings it will be "app"

    usage:
        Where and or how the string will be used. This is very loosely defined. Ideally when reading
        it will give the reader information about which string this is specifically.

        examples: leaveDialog, userNameFieldError.. etc.

        Special Usages:
        bullets - refers to a text separated by new lines that will be rendered with a each section having a bullet point
        parts - refers to a text separated by new lines that will be rendered with each section being separated by some spacer

    type:
        What type of component uses this string. We have a running list of logical types below.
        New types can be added as needed.

        label
        text
        header
        body
        hint
        link
        action
        a11y

-->

    <string name="appLanguageCode">en</string>
    <!--IMPORTANT: This must be at the top of each strings.xml file:
        When launching the app we compare the devices set language against the
        language being shown to the user in app (which is determined by the appLanguageCode above)
        If the device language is not supported we show a dialog explaining our support level
