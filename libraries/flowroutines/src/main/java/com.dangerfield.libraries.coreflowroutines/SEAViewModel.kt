/**
 * A view model that revolves around State (S), Events (E) and Actions (A)
 * Encourages a unidirectional flow of data from actions to state.
 *
 * S - State - The state of the view. Should be an immutable class that represents the
 * current state of the view. Should represent view state, NOT view element state
 * See https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/stateholders#elements-ui
 *
 * E - Event - Events are used to trigger one time events that should not be stored in the state.
 * Examples: Navigation, Showing a toast, etc...
 * Storing one time events in the state requires acknowledgment of the state from the view and can
 * lead to complications and bugs if not careful. Turns out to be easier to just roll with events in
 * a channel.
 *

 * A - Action - Actions are the only way to update state. They represent work to be done either user
 * triggered or from the view model itself.
 * Tips:
 * - If you need data to load on init, have the view model take an action in the init block.
 *
 * This viewmodel backs the state into the saved state handle if the state is savable.
 * See [SavedStateHandle.ACCEPTABLE_CLASSES]
